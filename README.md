## My process

I took a look at the Figma file and scanned through it to determine which colours and fonts where being used. Also took note of dimensions and corners.
After that, I moved onto the Folder in VSCode and started by adding necessary divs and paragraphs with proper class names. Then I created a CSS file
and I did all the editing needed to achieve the desired outcome based on the previous notes.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
